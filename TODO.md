# AI EcoScan - Implementation Progress

## 🌱 Project Overview
Building a mobile-friendly web app that uses phone camera + on-device AI to analyze objects and estimate ecological footprint in real-time.

## 📋 Implementation Stages

### ✅ STAGE 1: Core UI Structure & Layout (COMPLETED)
- [x] Create main app layout with navigation
- [x] Implement home dashboard with animated background
- [x] Build basic camera interface structure
- [x] Set up routing between screens
- [x] Add responsive design for mobile-first experience

### 🔄 STAGE 2: AI Integration & Scanning
- [ ] Install TensorFlow.js dependencies
- [ ] Integrate camera access with WebRTC
- [ ] Implement object detection system
- [ ] Create CO₂ footprint calculation logic
- [ ] Build scan result display with animations
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
